\section{Two Level Logic Synthesis Optimization}
We distinguish between sequential and combinational circuits, whose behaviour can be captured by finite-state machine state diagrams or by Boolean functions and relations. Often, sequential and combinational circuits are represented conveniently by mixed structural/behavioural models, such as  \textit{logic networks}. The goal of logic-level synthesis and optimization is to determine the microscopic structure of a circuit, i.e., its gate-level representation. \\
This chapter deals with the optimization of combinational logic circuits, modeled by two-level  \textit{sum of products}  expression forms.
